🧠 AI-Driven Wearable Health Analytics Platform

📌 Project Overview

This project is an AI-driven health analytics system built using wearable-like data (heart rate, sleep, stress, environment, activity, etc.).
The goal is to predict, explain, and visualize human health conditions such as sleep quality, stress load, recovery readiness, and illness risk—before they become visible.

Unlike traditional fitness trackers, this system focuses on root-cause analysis and predictive health insights, not just raw metrics.

Objwctive: This project aims to develop an AI-driven health coach that analyzes wearable and environmental data to predict health outcomes, identify root causes, and deliver personalized, preventive health guidance.
